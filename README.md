# Going Beyond Matplotlib and Seaborn:
## A survey of (better) Python data visualization tools 

Data practitioners have long complained about the dearth of easy to use, flexible data visualization tools in the Python ecosystem. In this repo, I'm housing materials for presentations/courses about the new generation of python dataviz options. These include some lesser known but powerful and easy to use tools for high quality data visualizations in Python, including plotnine, bokeh, Altair, and Plotly. 

The Old Standards
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

The New Generation
* [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)
* [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
