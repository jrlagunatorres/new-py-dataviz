# New Python Data Visualization Tools
## Beyond Matplotlib and Seaborn

Data practitioners have long complained about the dearth of easy to use, flexible data visualization tools in the Python ecosystem. In this repo, I'm housing materials for presentations/courses about the new generation of python dataviz options. These include some lesser known but powerful and easy to use tools for high quality data visualizations in Python, including plotnine, bokeh, Altair, and Plotly.

The Old Standards
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

The New Generation
* [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)
* [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)


## See the Tests

Because the visualizations are quite memory intensive, you'll need to download and run the code to see the visuals, but you can see all the code here.

* [Histogram](histogram.ipynb)
* [Scatterplot](scatter.ipynb)
* [Faceted Scatterplot](facets.ipynb)
* [Grouped Bar](groupbar.ipynb)
* [Time Series Line](timeline.ipynb)
* BONUS: [3D Scatterplot](scatter3d.ipynb)

**NOTE:** I am not claiming these are the only ways to produce these graphs, or even necessarily the best ways - I am approaching these tools as a moderately experienced user and showing the challenges that new folks may face when trying to get what they want. I hope this helps people decide which visualization tool to use for their own needs!
